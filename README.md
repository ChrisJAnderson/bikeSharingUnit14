## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis explores what profile of the typical Citibike rider in New York City. This analysis can be used to predict the profitability of Citibike operations in other cities. If the bikes see use mostly by tourists or on the weekends, they may be more profitable in cities with thriving tourist industries. If we see use that suggests consistent daily use, for example commuting to work, Citibike may be more profitable when stands are located around office buildings or residential areas of a city. 
## Results
### Breakdown by Gender
![](\images\byGender.png)   
Breaking the count of rides down by gender, we can see that the majority (65%) of riders are male.
### Breakdown by Customer Type

Breaking the data down by customer type, we can see that the majority of riders use the subscription model.
### Summary of Checkout Times
![](\images\checkoutTimes.png)  
Looking at a summary of checkout times shows us that the most common amount of time that a bike is checked out is around five minutes. Our typical rider isn't biking across the city, they're taking out bikes for convenience.
### Summary of Checkout Times by Gender
![](\images\checkoutTimesByGender.png)  
Breaking checkout times down further by gender shows that there isn't a huge difference between male and female riders, although the graph for the "unknown" gender is different, showing a usual ride of between 10 to 25 minutes.
### Summary of trip by gender
![](\images\tripsByGender.png)  
Looking at a graph of trips by gender, we can see that both males and females are most likely to ride during the week, and it is slightly more common for females to ride on the weekend (proportional to female rides during the week) than it is for males.
### Breakdown of daily trips by gender and usertype
![](\images\tripsByGenderUsertype.png)  
This graph mostly confirms what has already been discovered- male subscribers are our most common riders, they ride mostly during the week, and the overwhelming majority of customers overall are subscribed to Citibike.
Although not relevant to the analysis of the typical rider, it is interesting that customer rides are more commonly "unknown" than male or female and ride during the weekend- possibly tourists?
This would also explain why rides from "unknown" riders are longer.
### Summary of Trips by Weekday
![](\images\tripsByWeekday.png)  
This graph serves as an overview of our total trips by weekday to present a high-level view of the data, as it doesn't present any insights that haven't already been shown in the summary of trips by gender. I also include my analysis of the typical rider here within the story.
## High Level Summary
I believe our typical New York Citibike rider is a male full-time worker using Citibike as a convenient way to commute to and from work. They enjoy the subscription model for its convenience and affordability over the non-subscriber model. This presents an ideal customer, with a steady income from a full time job, a relatively low amount of time spent using the product as the rides are short, but still making Citibike a consistent amount of profit through subscription payments.
This data suggests that Citibike use should not be based around tourist use or weekend fun, but should be catered to the needs of 9 to 5 workers riding to and from the office.
Two additional visualizations I would like to see to confirm this are a breakdown of starting and stopping locations by gender (especially to see if there is a difference between male/female and "unknown", to test my theory that "unknown" riders are largely tourists) and/or by usertype, and a breakdown of use starting and stopping locations compared to public transit hubs.
